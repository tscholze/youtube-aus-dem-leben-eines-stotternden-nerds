======

This is the repository to host an introduction page for my tiny German YouTube experiment ["Aus dem Leben eines stotternden Nerds"](https://tscholze.github.io/youtube-aus-dem-leben-eines-stotternden-nerds). It features my own bug, the stuttering, as a feature and as main topic of the diffrent episodes.

If you want to know more about the person behind the podcast, in this case me, please go to my personal GitHub page [tscholze.github.io](https://tscholze.github.io)

For more information, please visit the rendered page of this repository.
Have a nice day.
